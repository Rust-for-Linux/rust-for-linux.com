# `gccrs`

[`gccrs`](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs) is an alternative compiler for the Rust
programming language, developed from the ground up for the
[GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)](https://gcc.gnu.org) project.

While `gccrs` is not yet able to compile Rust code, it is progressing fast — we are hoping we will be able to compile the Rust 1.49 `core` library in 2025 and the standard library with the GCC 16.1 release.

When `core` compiles properly, we will begin catching up to the Rust version used by Rust-for-Linux — in the hopes of being useful quickly!

You can follow the project's progress on [our blog](https://rust-gcc.github.io).
